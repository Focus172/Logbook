# Logbook

## Installing

1) Clone the repository with `git clone github.com/focus172/logbook`
2) Email estokdyk1@hwemail.com asking for the `GoogleService-Info.plist` and put it in the directory `~/logbook/logbook`. MAKE SURE WHEN YOU COMMIT TO NOT PUSH THIS FILE.
3) Run the Logbook.xcworkspace. If you run the .xcodeproj **it will not work**.
4) Press the play button and wait for the code to compile.

If you are getting something that says that something with google in the name doesn't exist then try this:

5) Install [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/).
6) Run 'pod install' withing the directory of the project. You will see some warning but should get a message the says it completed.
7) Restart xcode and try again.

## Project Structure
